## Answer the questions  

# What kind of security problems you have in your app?  
1. We didn't use TLS or SSL in our project to send the password.  
2. There maybe URL frauds when connecting to the php database.  
3. The directory is public  

# What you can do to induce the risk and improve security?
1. Use another type of encryption way for the transfering process of passwords.  
2. We will try to connect with password, instead of just a url in php platform.  
3. We try to create a special directory for each java class.
